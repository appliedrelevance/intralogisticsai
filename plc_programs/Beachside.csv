 COMMUNICATION SEQUENCE..,,,,,,
STORAGE TO RECEIVING SEQUENCE:,Cycle Steps,,,,,ERP MODBUS Actions
Sequence Step 1,PLC CYCLE RUNNING signal on,,,,,Check if this is HIGH before setting signals.  Report error if not. 
Sequence Step 2,ERP System turns on PICK BIN XX & TO RECEIVING STA 1 digital signals,,,,,Triggered by Material Receipt Stock Entry (before Submit) - Set PICK BIN XX and TO RECEIVING STA 1 high
Sequence Step 3,PLC communicates to STORAGE WAREHOUSE ROBOT ,,,,,
Sequence Step 4,    STORAGE WAREHOUSE ROBOT Starts Pick to Receiving Routine (from home position),,,,,
Sequence Step 5,PLC turns on PICK TO RECEIVING IN PROCESS digital signal,,,,,Wait for PICK ERROR or TO RECEIVING IN PROCESS set HIGH (timeout default 60 seconds or script parameter WAIT_TIMEOUT_SECS)
Sequence Step 6,ERP System turns off PICK BIN XX & TO RECEIVING STA 1 digital signals,,,,,Set PICK BIN XX and TO RECEIVING STA 1 to LOW
Sequence Step 7,    STORAGE WAREHOUSE ROBOT completes Pick and Place Routine (returns to home position),,,,,
Sequence Step 8,PLC turns off PICK TO RECEIVING IN PROCESS digital signal,,,,,Wait for PICK ERROR or PICK TO RECEIVING IN PROCESS
Sequence Step 9,PLC Pulse on PICK TO RECEIVING COMPLETE digital signal (1-sec.),,,,,Wait for PICK ERROR or PICK TO RECEIVING COMPLETE
Sequence Step 10,    Receiving Operator manually removes BIN from Gravity Conveyor 1,,,,,"If no PICK ERROR, submit the Stock Entry document."
Sequence Step 11,    Receiving Operator manually places Stock Entry parts in BIN Received from Storage,,,,,"If a PICK ERROR occurs, the submit will be rolled back and the Mateial Receipt document will remain in ""Saved"" status.  "
Sequence Step 12,    Receiving Operator Manually places BIN Received from Storage onto Gravity Conveyor 2,,,,,Create a Modbus Event logging the error
RECEIVING TO STORAGE SEQUENCE:,,,,,,
Sequence Step 13,PLC CYCLE RUNNING,,,,,
Sequence Step 14,PLC Detects R1 CONV 2 BIN PRESENT PE,,,,,How do I know which BIN is to receive the inventory?  I need that information to pick the warehouse location for the Material Transfer.  
Sequence Step 15,PLC Reads BIN RFID Tag and records BIN Number (Should be same as BIN # Picked to Receiving),,,,,
Sequence Step 16,PLC communicates BIN Location to STORAGE WAREHOUSE ROBOT ,,,,,
Sequence Step 17,    STORAGE WAREHOUSE ROBOT Starts Pick from RECEIVING to STORAGE Routine,,,,,
Sequence Step 18,PLC turns on PICK TO STORAGE IN PROCESS digital signal,,,,,Wait for PICK TO STORAGE IN PROCESS to be HIGH
Sequence Step 19,    STORAGE WAREHOUSE ROBOT completes Pick and Place Routine (returns to home position),,,,,Generate a Material Transfer Stock Entry document.
Sequence Step 20,PLC turns off PICK TO STORAGE WAREHOUSE IN PROCESS digital signal,,,,,Save the Material Transfer Stock Entry document when PICK TO STORAGE IN PROCESS is HIGH
Sequence Step 21,PLC Pulse on PICK TO STORAGE WAREHOUSE COMPLETE digital signal (1-sec.),,,,,"If no PICK ERROR, Submit the Material Transfer Stock Entry document."
Sequence Step 22,Return to Sequence Step 1,,,,,
,NOTE: A PICK ERROR digital signal indicates an incompleted sequence ,,,,,"If PICK ERROR, roll back the submit of the Material Transfer Stock Entry Document"
OR,and should be treated as an INCOMPLETE ORDER in the ERP SYSTEM,,,,,Create a Modbus Event logging the error.

STORAGE TO PICK AND PACK SEQUENCE:,,,,,,ERP MODBUS Actions
Sequence Step 1,PLC CYCLE RUNNING,,,,,Check if this is HIGH before setting signals.  Report error if not. 
Sequence Step 2,ERP System turns on PICK BIN XX & TO PICK & PACK  STA 2 digital signals,,,,,Triggered by Pick List (before Submit) - Set PICK BIN XX and TO PICK&PACK STA 1 high
Sequence Step 3,PLC communicates to STORAGE WAREHOUSE ROBOT ,,,,,
Sequence Step 4,    STORAGE WAREHOUSE ROBOT Starts Pick BIN XX from STORAGE to PICK & PACK Routine,,,,,
Sequence Step 5,PLC turns on PICK TO PICK & PACK IN PROCESS digital signal,,,,,Wait for PICK ERROR or TO PICK&PACK IN PROCESS set HIGH (timeout default 60 seconds or script parameter WAIT_TIMEOUT_SECS)
Sequence Step 6,ERP System turns off PICK BIN XX & TO PICK & PACK STA 2 digital signals,,,,,Set PICK BIN XX and TO PICK&PACK STA 1 to LOW
Sequence Step 7,STORAGE WAREHOUSE ROBOT completes Pick from STORAGE to PICK & PACK Routine,,,,,
Sequence Step 8,PLC turns off PICK TO PICK & PACK IN PROCESS digital signal,,,,,Wait for PICK ERROR or PICK TO PICK&PACK IN PROCESS
Sequence Step 9,PLC Pulse on PICK TO PICK & PACK COMPLETE digital signal (1-sec.),,,,,Wait for PICK ERROR or PICK TO PICK&PACK COMPLETE
Sequence Step 10,    PICK & PACK Operator manually packs parts from BIN/S XX into Shipping Bin,,,,,"If no PICK ERROR, submit the Stock Entry document."
Sequence Step 11,    PICK & PACK Operator manually places BIN XX on gravity Conveyor 4 (Return to Storage),,,,,"If a PICK ERROR occurs, the submit will be rolled back and the Mateial Receipt document will remain in ""Saved"" status.  "
Sequence Step 12,    PICK & PACK Operator manually places Shipping Bin with all packed parts on Conveyor 6,,,,,Create a Modbus Event logging the error
